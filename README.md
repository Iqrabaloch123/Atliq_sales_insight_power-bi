**Problem Statement:**
The sales director at AtliQ Hardware, a company operating in computer hardware and peripherals across India, is encountering challenges in accurately assessing the business performance and identifying existing problems. Sales have been below expectations and are gradually declining. When the director seeks updates from regional managers regarding sales and market conditions, they tend to withhold or sugarcoat information, inundating the director with Excel files instead of providing transparent insights.

**Proposed Solution:**
To address these challenges, the sales director of AtliQ Hardware has opted to develop a PowerBI Dashboard. This dashboard aims to transform raw data into visual representations, facilitating data-driven decision-making processes. Consequently, a team of data professionals has been recruited to undertake this task.

AIMS Grid
By using the AIMS grid project management tool, we made sure what are the purpose, stakeholder, end result and success criteria of our project.

**Project Steps:**
1. Conducted a comprehensive high-level analysis of the data using SQL to gain deeper insights and understanding.
2. Established a connection between the SQL dataset and PowerBI for seamless data integration.
3. Executed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes and performed thorough data cleaning to ensure data integrity and reliability.
4. Addressed currency discrepancies within the transactions by implementing currency conversion methods, standardizing all currency types.
5. Developed measures as per the specific requirements and utilized them to generate informative visuals within PowerBI.
6. Reviewed the initial report with stakeholders and incorporated necessary revisions and enhancements based on their feedback to ensure alignment with their expectations.
